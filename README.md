# SE-Assignment-6
 Assignment: Introduction to Python
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of Python programming. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

 Questions:

1. Python Basics:
   - What is Python, and what are some of its key features that make it popular among developers? Provide examples of use cases where Python is particularly effective.

Sure, let's go through each topic step by step:

1. Python Basics
Python:
Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It supports multiple programming paradigms like procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.

Key Features:

Readable and Simple Syntax: Python's syntax is clean and easy to understand, making it accessible for beginners and enjoyable for experienced developers.
Extensive Standard Library: Python comes with a large standard library that supports many common programming tasks, reducing the need for external libraries.
Versatility: Python is widely used across various domains such as web development (Django, Flask), scientific computing (NumPy, SciPy), data analysis (Pandas), artificial intelligence (TensorFlow, PyTorch), etc.
Use Cases:

Web Development: Frameworks like Django and Flask are popular for building web applications.
Data Science and Machine Learning: Libraries such as NumPy, Pandas, and TensorFlow are extensively used for data manipulation, analysis, and machine learning tasks.
Scripting and Automation: Python's simplicity and versatility make it ideal for writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks.

2. Installing Python:
   - Describe the steps to install Python on your operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux). Include how to verify the installation and set up a virtual environment.
Windows: Download the installer from python.org, run it, and select "Add Python to PATH" during installation.
macOS: Python is pre-installed on macOS. Use the Terminal to check and install using Homebrew if necessary.
Linux: Use the package manager (apt, yum, dnf, etc.) to install Python. Ensure to install python3 and python3-pip.
Verification and Virtual Environment:

Verify installation by typing python --version or python3 --version in the command prompt/terminal.
Set up a virtual environment using venv or virtualenv to isolate dependencies for different projects.


3. Python Syntax and Semantics:
   - Write a simple Python program that prints "Hello, World!" to the console. Explain the basic syntax elements used in the program.

print("Hello, World!")


4. Data Types and Variables:
   - List and describe the basic data types in Python. Write a short script that demonstrates how to create and use variables of different data types.

int: Integer numbers (5, -10).
float: Floating-point numbers (3.14, 2.718).
str: String of characters ("hello", 'world').
bool: Boolean values (True, False)

5. Control Structures:
   - Explain the use of conditional statements and loops in Python. Provide examples of an `if-else` statement and a `for` loop.

# Example of if-else statement
age = 20
if age >= 18:
    print("Adult")
else:
    print("Minor")
# Example of for loop
for i in range(1, 5):
    print(i)


6. Functions in Python:
   - What are functions in Python, and why are they useful? Write a Python function that takes two arguments and returns their sum. Include an example of how to call this function.

# Function to add two numbers
def add_numbers(a, b):
    return a + b

# Calling the function
result = add_numbers(3, 7)
print("Sum:", result)  # Output: Sum: 10


7. Lists and Dictionaries:
   - Describe the differences between lists and dictionaries in Python. Write a script that creates a list of numbers and a dictionary with some key-value pairs, then demonstrates basic operations on both.

Lists: Ordered collection of items ([1, 2, 3]). Accessed by index.
Dictionaries: Unordered collection of key-value pairs ({"name": "Alice", "age": 30}). Accessed by key.
# Lists and Dictionaries
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
person = {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}

# Accessing elements
print(numbers[0])         # Output: 1
print(person["name"])     # Output: Alice


8. Exception Handling:
   - What is exception handling in Python? Provide an example of how to use `try`, `except`, and `finally` blocks to handle errors in a Python script.

Used to handle errors gracefully
# Example with try, except, finally
try:
    x = 1 / 0
except ZeroDivisionError:
    print("Error: Division by zero!")
finally:
    print("Execution completed.")


9. Modules and Packages:
   - Explain the concepts of modules and packages in Python. How can you import and use a module in your script? Provide an example using the `math` module.

Module: A file containing Python definitions, statements, and functions.
Package: A collection of related Python modules
# Using math module
import math

print(math.sqrt(16))   # Output: 4.0 (square root)


10. File I/O:
    - How do you read from and write to files in Python? Write a script that reads the content of a file and prints it to the console, and another script that writes a list of strings to a file.

# Reading from a file
with open('example.txt', 'r') as file:
    content = file.read()
    print(content)

# Writing to a file
data = ['apple', 'banana', 'cherry']
with open('fruits.txt', 'w') as file:
    for fruit in data:
        file.write(fruit + '\n')


# Submission Guidelines:
- Your answers should be well-structured, concise, and to the point.
- Provide code snippets or complete scripts where applicable.
- Cite any references or sources you use in your answers.
- Submit your completed assignment by [due date].
